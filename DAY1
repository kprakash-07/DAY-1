DAY 1: 
PROBLEM 1: IPL Ticket Rush
DAIICT college students want to attend an IPL match.
A total of N students from the college want to go while only M tickets are available for the match.
Determine how many students won't be able to book tickets.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers N and M — the number of students wants to go and the total number of tickets available, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of students who won't be able to book tickets.

Constraints:
1≤T≤1000
1≤N,M≤10^5

CODE:

   T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    result=0
    N,M=map(int,input().split())
    result=N-M
    if(result<0):
        print('0')
    else:
        print(result)

Sample input:
4
5 3
5 7
4 1
8 8

Sample output:
2
